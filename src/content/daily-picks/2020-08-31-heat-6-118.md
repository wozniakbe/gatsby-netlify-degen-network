The Heat come into this series with more rest than the Bucks, as the Bucks are only coming off one day of rest, where they defeated the 8-seeded Magic 4 games to 1. Miami last played a week ago, impressively taking the Pacers down in the series 4 to 1. 

The Heat beat the bucks in 2 out of 3 meetings this season, the one loss coming in the bubble back on August 6th when the Bucks came back and won by 14 after being down 17 at half, a cover for the ages. The Bucks come in as the fastest playing team in the league, so the heat will try to slow down the pace and play a halfcourt game and take the game over with their shooting. With the shooting and spacing that the Heat present, it will be tough for Milwaukeeâ€™s big men to guard the perimeter and come out of the paint to play defense. Give me the points with the Heat here.
