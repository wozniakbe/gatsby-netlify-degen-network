Avs/Stars Over 6 Goals +112 1U , Avs/Stars Over 6.5 Goals +150 .5U

Death, taxes, and playing Avs overs. The avalanche are forced to start either their struggling Goalie Pavel Francouz (3.23 GAA, .892 save % in playoffs) or Michael Hutchinson (career 2.80 GAA, .905 save %) who has been relegated to a 3rd string goalie after struggling in Toronto the last 2 years. **Dallas** on the other hand will be forced to start Khudobin as their primary goalie Ben Bishop is injured. While he has been impressive in the playoffs for the most part, he has been a benefactor or Colorado's extremely poor goal-tending and Dallas' sudden spur of offense. Regardless, he has given up at least 4 goals in every game this series. Not to mention being a 33 year-old goalie playing a back-to-back with no rest doesn't bode well, especially against the youngest team in the playoffs with a high octane offense.
